venv for the virtual environment.
## Practical List
### List of Practicals
1. Write a program to find the roots of a quadratic equation.
2. Write a program to accept a number ‘n’ and a. Check if ’n’ is prime b. Generate all prime
numbers till ‘n’ c. Generate first ‘n’ prime numbers This program may be done using functions.
3. Write a program to create a pyramid of the character ‘*’ and a reverse pyramid.
4. Write a program that accepts a character and performs the following:
a. print whether the character is a letter or numeric digit or a special character,
b. if the character is a letter, print whether the letter is uppercase or lowercase, and
c. if the character is a numeric digit, prints its name in text. (e.g., if input is 9, output is
NINE)
5. Write a program to perform the following operations on a string:
a. Find the frequency of a character in a string,
b. Replace a character by another character in a string,
c. Remove the first occurrence of a character from a string, and
d. Remove all occurrences of a character from a string.
6. Write a program to swap the first n characters of two strings.
7. Write a function that accepts two strings and returns the indices of all the occurrences of the
second string in the first string as a list. If the second string is not present in the first string then
it should return -1.
8. Write a program to create a list of the cubes of only the even integers appearing in the input
list (may have elements of other types also) using the following:
a. 'for' loop, and
b. list comprehension.
9. Write a program to read a file and:
a. Print the total number of characters, words and lines in the file,
b. Calculate the frequency of each character in the file. Use a variable of dictionary type\
to maintain the count, and
c. Print the words in reverse order, and
d. Copy even lines of the file to a file named ‘File1’ and odd lines to another file named
‘File2’.
10. Write a program to define a class Point with coordinates x and y as attributes. Create
relevant methods and print the objects. Also define a method distance to calculate the distance
between any two point objects.
11. Write a function that prints a dictionary where the keys are numbers between 1 and 5 and
the values are cubes of the keys.
12. Consider a tuple t1=(1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10). Write a program to perform following
operations:
a. Print half the values of the tuple in one line and the other half in the next line,
b. Print another tuple whose values are even numbers in the given tuple.
c. Concatenate a tuple t2=(11,13,15) with t1, and
d. Return maximum and minimum value from this tuple.
13. Write a program to accept a name from a user. Raise and handle appropriate exception(s) if
the text entered by the user contains digits and/or special characters.
